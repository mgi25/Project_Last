# Newton + AI Hybrid Forex Scalping Bot

This repository contains a fully modular trading system for MetaTrader 5 (MT5) focused on high-frequency scalping on the 1-minute timeframe. The bot combines mathematical optimization, classical quantitative strategies, machine learning, and reinforcement learning to trade major forex pairs using the Exness broker.

## Features
- **Data Handling:** Connects to MetaTrader 5 for tick and OHLC data retrieval or uses locally cached data in backtesting mode.
- **Optimization Stack:** Newtonâ€“Raphson optimizer for fast parameter tuning, gradient and Bayesian optimization for global search.
- **Trading Strategies:** Multiple engines (trend, mean reversion, breakout) with a fusion ensemble that weights each engine by recent accuracy.
- **Machine Learning:** Configurable pipeline supporting Random Forest or LSTM models with automated retraining from trading logs.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** PPO/DDPG integration using `stable-baselines3` with offline and online learning support.
- **Risk Controls:** Kelly criterion-based sizing, Newton-optimized SL/TP, trailing stops, daily loss/profit caps, and panic exits.
- **Execution Layer:** Robust MT5 order management with retry logic and a built-in simulation mode.
- **Continuous Learning:** Automated daily retraining and parameter re-optimization with persisted artifacts in `models/`.

## Usage
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Update `config.json` with your MetaTrader 5 account credentials and desired parameters.
3. Run the bot:
   ```bash
   python -m bot_core.main --config config.json
   ```
4. Use `--mode backtest` for historical simulation or `--mode live` for live trading.
